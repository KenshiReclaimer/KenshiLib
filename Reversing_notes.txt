Ogre:
	Commit is either 9bc4de5b68c8ffe6a303b494af01e733ea52926d or 174ab3f81f0301a345ae9a276a770d33c67a236a
	Reasoning:
		Newer than this (no _swapVisibleObjectsForShadowMapping): d742911b5e50efdcfc7c439834e1d20fb60500e5
		Older than this (doesn't have this fix): 1e128dacd101e76bafaa827a5cd85daff3527de0
		Only commit in that range that effects x64 SSE2 D3D11 builds is 174ab3f81f0301a345ae9a276a770d33c67a236a
	Other notes:
		Appears to use nedmalloc with pooling
		Probably boost as thread provider
		CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX doesn't seem to work for me, so I manually add `_x64` to the generated VC++ projects after CMake generation
