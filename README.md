# Compilation instructions
Install Windows 7.1 SDK.
You may also need to set your parent project to compile using the 7.1 SDK, and possibly set the environment variable WindowsSDK_IncludePath to Windows 7.1 SDK include dir.

Install Boost 1.60.0
Set environment variable "BOOST_INCLUDE_PATH" to your boost install location (correct path will contain a folder called "boost" with headers inside)
